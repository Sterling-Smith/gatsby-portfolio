Sterling Smith is a software engineer turned startup founder based in Austin, Texas. After working in industry at Walmart, Lockheed Martin and Booz Allen Hamilton, Sterling founded his first company, 
LaunchPartner.co in 2013. LaunchPartner.co’s mission is to help non-technical subject matter experts launch their MVP’s. Their philosophy is that <Underlining color="#CDF3E1" hoverColor="#CDF3E1">“if it can’t be built within 8 weeks, it’s probably not an MVP”.</Underlining>  

Sterling launched his second company Sandbox Commerce, in early 2017.  Sandbox Commerce enables traditional retailers to launch bespoke, rapidly scalable mobile apps quickly via their no-code platform. <Underlining color="#CDF3E1" hoverColor="#CDF3E1">The app is 
particularly adaptable to today’s retail woes, because it enables contactless curbside commerce, appointment scheduling, last-mile delivery and other services to allow consumers to access products from a safe distance.</Underlining> 
And retailers can launch their apps on both iOS and Google Play AppStore.
